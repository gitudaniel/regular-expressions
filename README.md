# Regular Expressions
## An introduction and some examples on using regular expressions

This repository is meant for those who are curious but do not want to delve too deep into regular expressions.
If you want to go straight to the source I'll direct you to  Doug Hellman's blog (https://pymotw.com/2/re/).
He goes into much more detail and that is the source of my content.
